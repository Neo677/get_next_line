The second of the two Divisions of "The Transcendental Logic", "The Transcendental Dialectic", 
contains the "negative" portion of Kant's Critique, which builds upon the "positive" arguments of the preceding 
"Transcendental Analytic" to expose the limits of metaphysical speculation. In particular,
it is concerned to demonstrate as spurious the efforts of reason to arrive at knowledge independent of sensibility. 
This endeavor, Kant argues, is doomed to failure, which he claims to demonstrate by showing that reason, unbounded by sense,
 is always capable of generating opposing or otherwise incompatible conclusions. Like "the light dove, 
 in free flight cutting through the air, the resistance of which it feels", reason "could get the idea that it could do even better 
 in airless space".[119] Against this, Kant claims that, absent epistemic friction, there can be no knowledge. Nevertheless,
  Kant's critique is not entirely destructive. He presents the speculative excesses of traditional metaphysics as inherent in our very 
  capacity of reason.Moreover, he argues that its products are not without some (carefully qualified) regulative value.
